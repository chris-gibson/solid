Iteration 1:

PM:
"
We are trying to build an education tool for kids aged 6-10.
Kids can learn about birds in this tool. Tomorrow, it might include other objects such as transportation types. We don't know the scope yet.

In this iteration, we shall have a couple of birds.

Kids can name a bird. So all birds should have a naming capability.

Raven and Nightingale are two birds that we shall start with.

We will demonstrate to kids, flying and making noise behaviors of these birds.

Kids and select birds and see these behaviors.

"

Iteration 2:

PM:

"
Penguins are a cool idea given by Mr.Gibson, Chris's dad.

Lets add Penguins to the system
"

Retrospective:

Oh No! Penguins are flying in your implementation. We should not be teaching kids incorrect things.

Lets fix this!
