//Iteration 1

1. Application has a Shopping cart
2. Users can add products
3. Application should be able to find out the total cost and display it to the user.

//Iteration 2

4. We need to be able to give discounts.

Discount rules are as follows.

Less than 5 items, 0 discount

5-10 items 10% discount

11-15 items 12% discount


5. We should tell the person how much discount he got on the total


// Iteration 3: More rules have been added to the system

More than 15 items 25% discount

//Iteration 4: Existing rules have been changed etc



May be they will change not based on # of items, based on competition but some other strategy!!

You get a hint of this from a PM.

First, YAGNI and KISS

Second, Anticipate change and apply a principle/pattern.
